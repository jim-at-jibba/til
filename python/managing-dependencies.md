# Managing dependencies

Unlike Nodejs, python does not have a nice way of handling dependencies between team members.
By default packages are installed globally. This is not great when working on a project as a team
as you can get into issues where different team members have different version of the same package.

Peotry provides a similar experience to NPM.
